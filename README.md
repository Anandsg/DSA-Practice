# Daily DSA Solutions in JavaScript and C++

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I post daily solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms problems in JavaScript and C++. This repository is meant to serve as a resource for learning and practicing DSA concepts through code.

## About

In this repository, you will find a collection of my daily solutions to various DSA problems. Each solution is provided in both JavaScript and C++, showcasing the implementation in two popular programming languages.

## Motivation

The primary goal of this repository is to share my journey of improving my DSA skills. By solving a problem every day and implementing it in different languages, I aim to reinforce my understanding of various algorithms and data structures.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each day's solution. Inside each folder, you'll find the following:

- `DSA javascript`: This folder contains the JavaScript solution for the day's problem.
- `DSA c++`: This folder contains the C++ solution for the day's problem.
- `README.md`: A detailed explanation of the problem, its approach, and the code in both languages.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them as a reference for your own learning. If you're stuck on a particular problem, you can refer to the corresponding solution and its explanation in the `README.md` file.

Please keep in mind that these solutions are intended for educational purposes and may not always represent the most optimized or efficient implementations.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute your solutions or improvements to existing solutions, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/new-solution`
3. Add your solution code and explanations.
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add solution for problem XYZ'`
5. Push the branch to your forked repository: `git push origin feature/new-solution`
6. Open a pull request to this repository's `main` branch.
